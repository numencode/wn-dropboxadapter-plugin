### Changes
- Implemented **OAuth2 Refresh Token Flow** for Dropbox authentication.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-07-08
### Added
- Initial release of the **DropboxAdapter Plugin**.
- Laravel filesystem integration with the Dropbox v2 API.
- Fully compatible with **Winter CMS v1.2.7** and **PHP 8.0+**.
- Use case: enables Dropbox as a remote storage option for backups, sync operations, and custom filesystem logic.
- Designed for integration with plugins like [`NumenCode.SyncOps`](https://github.com/numencode/wn-syncops-plugin).

### Notes
- **Not compatible** with `media` or `uploads` disks in Winter CMS.
- Intended for developer-oriented scenarios such as automation, deployment, or remote sync â€” not general file management.
